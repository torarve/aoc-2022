[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## Day 1
[Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) is a simple starter problem.
The main challenge is parsing a file containing a groups of numbers, separated
by a blank line. Once that is done, it is just finding the largest number (part 1)
and the sum of the three largest numbers (part 2.)

## Day 2
[Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) is yet a simple problem, but it 
requires translating letters to rock, paper, or scissors. And to make it a 
bit more challenging, the meaning changes in part. I decided not to decode
the letters in code, and just added a function that translated for the 
second part.

## Day 3
[Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) requires you to find the common
element in sets. This is a common problem and most programming languages 
have some support for it. The main differences between the two parts are
(1) how to find the sets and (2) the number of sets.
